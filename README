This is my a level computing project.

Here is a very very quick overview of my project.

The idea was to make a webapp for a hockey team where they can stand on the pitch side
after the game and are presented with a pre selected list of names showing who has played
and then the captain can check off who has 'paid' as this would allow the treasurer to go
home and not have to insert them all his self into an excel sheet. Instead he could go home
and log in and create reports on the fixtures that were played that day, or on the teams.

Once the games have been played and someone hasn't paid; then using mailers an email should
be sent out reminding the person that they have not paid for a game. If there is a running
total the! Mailer should query the database and find all un-paid subs for the same player.
